# ECE366-Software-Engineering
Four goombas in a trench coat build production level software

# TODO @JOEY @JERRY
Build groups pages
-need object creation and dynamic linking
-need to figure out how to render/store images
-booleans for admin, private statuses
-group and event creation methods
-put methods for admin on group creation or admin designation
-only admins get even posting permission
Figure out persistent login
-keep in mind that most React "history" tutorials are deprecated
-login determines authorization to access rest of site, also required for private and admin permissions
Figure out messaging
-when someone accesses their "messages" (should only be displayed to logged in users), simply render list of
recieved messages
-if an admin, display sent messages somewhere else (maybe within the group)
